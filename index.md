I am happy to provide recommendations or support letters for students who have completed at least one of my elective courses or whom I've advised in research. This and a week's notice are necessary conditions. If you would like me to write substantive and informative letters, you'd be better served by performing well in my courses and engaging productively in class. I only write confidential letters, sent directly to the institution, to ensure my evaluations are candid and objective.

## Various and sundry

Between December 2023 and February 2024, I was shuttling (actually, riding or pillion-riding a motorbike) across the Tamil Nadu and Kerala border (Palakkad-Pollachi), conducting fieldwork for the Valuing Democracy project. Some stills from the field: 

<img src="Palakkad_Vengodi_Training.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> <img src="Palakkad_Para_LunchPlace.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> 

Debriefing and training enumerators at the field office in Vengodi, Palakkad. Our go-to lunch place was Hotel Venkatesh Bhavan -- uses a wood-fired stove for cooking and redolent of [Malgudi Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIYA5qANs_A).

<img src="PoliticianInterview_Ramassery.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> <img src="Idli_Ramassery.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> 

We interviewed scores of politicians: here is one with Libin and a stopover for the famed Ramasseri idli with Sreenivasan Ji. [Is it an idli or a dosa?](https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ramasseri-idli-a-fusion-of-an-idli-and-a-dosa/article34206074.ece)

<img src="Palakkad_Thenari_TeaShopDiscussion.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> <img src="Pollachi_Thimmanguthu.png" width="225" height="150" /> 

An impromptu discussion at a tea stall (with the stall owner, an insightful, white-bearded, old friend of Sreenivasan Ji's father) and the trusted Honda that got us around. 

<img src="Palakkad_Vengodi_Handloom.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> <img src="Palakkad_SilentValley_Trees.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> 

An inspiring visit to the [Khadi](https://www.mkgandhi.org/swadeshi_khadi/whatiskhadi.htm) cottage industry next door (we bought handmade fabric for made-to-fit shirts by a local tailor) and taking in the moment with a view of the Silent Valley. 



<!-- You can find fieldwork pictures on our [Greening the Margin project here](https://tizianacentofanti.wixsite.com/personalwebsite/gallery) and --> 

Here is my sketch (below) of a bestselling book my daughter recommended I read, and I recommend you do; [it's a short read](https://www.charliemackesy.com/). 

<img src="theboythemule.png" width="150" height="200" /> 

And a dated picture of traditional seed sowing on my parents' farm in Tamil Nadu, India (below, on the left) and me breaking traditions (on the right).

My brother worked on [the effect of angular momentum or spin velocity in the formation of galaxies](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/483/2/2398/5222687); more recently on examining [the interactive effect of angular momentum and gravitation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08103.pdf) in the formation of celestial bodies. My brother lives in the part of the world where, in theory, water flowing down the drain is expected to spin in the opposite direction compared to the drains in parts I am in... ;) <br/>

*"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself -- and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that." - Richard Feynman at Caltech, 1974*

<p style="font-size: x-small;"> <!--  Excerpt from my 2015 Research Statement, which continues to hold today (I've mixed feelings about this consistency): `` ...The underlying theme of my research is throwing light on issues of society, where individual interest and a larger collective bargain are divergent ...and seeing how institutional arrangements, legal, social or economic, can improve individual incentives for better collective outcomes..."-->
